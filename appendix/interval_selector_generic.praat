#  Interval Selector Script
########################################################################################
#  This script adds a "target" tier (tier 1) to mark the target interval in a long textgrid.
#  Each labeled interval on a given tier is compared against a list of targets, and if the
#  interval is on the target list, the interval is copied to the "target" tier, along with 
#  its label.
#
#  Input:   TextGrids with labeled tiers (presumably output from forced
#              aligner)
#  Output:  TextGrids with an added tier, named according to the original file.
#  
#  Additional files:   targets.txt (or similar) with a list of targets (e.g., words or phones)
#				 *must be in a "resources" folder inside the folder containing this script*
#
#  Process: The script asks for a directory in which to look for textgrid files, and a tier
#           number in which to search for targets. It then looks for TextGrids in the specified 
#           folder. For each textgrid, first, a new tier (tier 1) is created to mark targets.  
#	        Then, labeled intervals in the word tier are located. For labels that are listed
#           in the targets file, the script then copies that interval and label to the new 
#           target tier. Each new textgrid is saved as a new .textgrid file with the appendix  
#           "-target".  After all intervals in all files inthe specified directory have been 
#           examined, a finish message appears.
